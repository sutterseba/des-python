# DES-Python

A simple DES implementation in Python

The **D**ata **E**ncryption **S**tandard, used from 1977 until the standardisation of AES in 2001 marked the beginning of modern cryptography as we know it today.

This implementation is **not**, under any circumstances, intended for actual usage as its sole purpose is educational.
Note that it is also quite slow.

Contributing and/or critique is very welcome!
