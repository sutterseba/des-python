# DES-Python

A simple DES implementation in Python

## DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION

This implementation is solely intended for educational purposes.
Note that it is also very slow (and quite possibly wrong).

**Note:** The file encryption uses basic ECB mode which, again, is not secure for encrypting files.

Contributing and/or critique is very welcome!
